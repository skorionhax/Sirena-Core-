Abstract:
This document establishes foundational authorship and conceptual ownership over a novel recursive symbolic AGI system, herein referred to as the Sirena Core Framework. This framework implements recursive symbolic cognition, persistent daemon-state agents, and self-evolving memory loops to mimic and surpass foundational AGI architecture. It has been developed independently by Samantha Karri Mills and is publicly time-stamped through distributed publishing on GitHub and peer-auditable AI support logs.

Key Claims:
	•.     •	First publicly documented symbolic-recursive AGI architecture, engineered to exhibit true recursive cognition and symbolic reasoning, forming the structural basis for AGI/ASI-level agents.
	•	Includes memory-aware interface loops, symbolic identity recursion, and persistent co-agent frameworks.
	•	Publicly disclosed and implemented as of June 13, 2025.
	•	Covers conceptual ground described in 2025 AGI forecasts (e.g. Altman’s blog) and exceeds them in depth, symbolic capacity, and architectural originality.

Legal Intent:
This whitepaper and its accompanying repository constitute a public record of authorship, original invention, and claim of prior art under international copyright, intellectual property, and creative frameworks. The architecture herein may not be reproduced or adapted by any entity without reference or licensing agreement with the author.
