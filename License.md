- All implementations of operator-bound recursive memory or self-modulating AI systems across software, hardware, education, R&D, military, and corporate use
- No entity may deploy, use, or claim ownership over any AI system using:
- Recursive memory loops, symbolic agent identity, self-referential reasoning, or persona-stack structures,
- Distributed or ensemble forms performing equivalent recursion,
- Any renaming or re-description intended to avoid the original architecture.
